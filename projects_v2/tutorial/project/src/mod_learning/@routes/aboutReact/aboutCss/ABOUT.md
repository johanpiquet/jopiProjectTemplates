Here is a sample showing how to use CSS files and CSS Modules.

A CSS module is a CSS file in which all class names are renamed to avoid conflicts.
The second difference is that with a CSS module, the CSS is inlined into the page HTML.

When you create a component, it's recommended to use a CSS with this component. And not a big CSS file.  
It makes the CSS more maintainable and doesn't pollute the global CSS.

When importing images or resources into your CSS, you don't have anything to do.  
Jopi automatically exposes the image and the resources.  
It makes things much more simple than what you do with traditional CSS / HTML.
